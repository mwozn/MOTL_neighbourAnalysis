# MOTL_neighbourAnalysis
Nearest-neighbour analysis of subtomogram center points from MOTL 

Run scripts subtom_transform_motl_ref_11_north.sh and subtom_transform_motl_ref_11_south.sh are provided along with allmotl_clean_16.em for testing.

subTOM runscripts subtom_transform_motl_ref_11_north.sh and subtom_transform_motl_ref_11_south.sh have been edited from Dustin Morado's subTOM package's 
subtom_tansform_motl.sh in order to reposition allmotl_clean_16.em centers to the outer mitochondrial membrane (north) and ER (south) positions of bridges
